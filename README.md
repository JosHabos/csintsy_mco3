### Case Study on Housing Prices
### _Done on Jupyter Notebook with Python_

This repository contains the main notebook, originaly done on Google Collab. The dataset of interest is on the prices of Californian housing in a certain district, taken from a 1990 census. Other relative variables are listed and explained in the notebook. The dataset is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices

The notebook first goes over the data preprocessing of the dataset, determining the independent and dependent variables. A linear regression model is constructed as the prediction model for determining what variables affect the price of housing, in the context of the dataset. Data visualization is done to observe the effectiveness of the model, which show that only a few variables are able to significantly predict housing prices. Then, the same model is tested against an updated version of the dataset, with the removal of outliers. This is done to see if the model can be further improved. Results from the tests show that the model does improve, but only slightly. Despite lackluster results, understanding on how housing prices fared in the past was gained.The study validates the notion that housing prices have varied significantly based on different factors, corroborating the alternate hypothesis that proximity to the ocean influences house values.
